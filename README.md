# Wave-app
A simple tide forecast app built with React Native. 

This app was created to enter into the [Masergy](https://www.masergy.com/stem-scholarship/) STEM scholarship oppurtunity for the Spring of 2019. I wanted to create a stylish and useful tide forecast app that implemented tasteful UI components and showcased the hard work I achieved.

# Development Stack
- I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on OSX to create this app
- [Expo](https://expo.io/) was  was used to create, run, and test for development
- Currently only tested on an IOS device

# API's
- Tidal forecast data is retrieved without a key from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | U.S. Department of Commerce](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.html)
- Breakdown of their API data usage can be found [here](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/#units)
- No API key is needed to run this app
